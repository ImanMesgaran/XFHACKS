XFHACKS Series!
==============

Let me share me hacking around Xamarin.Forms to get cool shi*t done with ease! ;) 

No custom renderers, no platform specific code and no third party libraries! Just by using pure out of the box Xamarin.Forms! ;) 
(I know right, sounds so impossible! but watch me make impossible possible with pure Xamarin.Forms!)
